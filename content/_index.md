Every complex problem has a structure. Most people work on the surface. I go deeper.

My approach starts with decomposition — breaking systems, processes, and strategies down to their smallest meaningful parts. No assumptions survive unchallenged. From that foundation, I rebuild: selecting only what serves the objective, in the most effective configuration the constraints allow.

This isn't theory. It's how I identified €1B in cost savings at a Porsche subsidiary, how I architect software-defined vehicle platforms, and how I help organizations integrate AI where it actually creates value — not where it sounds impressive.

I bring fifteen years across nuclear engineering, automotive technology, strategic consulting, and defense systems. MIT trained me to think in first principles. Roland Berger trained me to make them actionable. BMW and MHP trained me to ship.

If you're facing a problem that resists conventional approaches — or if you suspect the conventional approach is the problem — I'd like to hear about it.
