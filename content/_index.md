  - title: "Problem Decomposition"
    description: "Most consultants optimize what exists. I question whether it should exist at all. Using first principles, I break your challenge down to its fundamental parts — stripping away assumptions, inherited processes, and conventional wisdom — until we find the actual problem. Then we rebuild."
  - title: "AI Readiness & Implementation"
    description: "You're under pressure to adopt AI but unclear where it creates real value versus expensive noise. I map your operations to identify where AI delivers measurable impact, build the business case, and help implement — not with generic tools, but with solutions matched to your specific constraints."
  - title: "Growth Architecture"
    description: "Linear growth comes from working harder. Exponential growth comes from working differently. I apply private equity growth frameworks to identify the structural changes — in process, technology, and strategy — that unlock step-change performance. I see potential where others have already moved on."
  - title: "High-Stakes Technology Decisions"
    description: "When millions are on the line and the wrong technology bet means years lost, you need more than a vendor comparison. I provide deep technical analysis, risk assessment, and implementation roadmaps for decisions where getting it right matters more than getting it fast."

I listen first.

Most of my work starts the same way: a company has a problem they've been trying to solve, sometimes for years. They've brought in tools, hired people, restructured teams. Some of it helped. Most of it treated symptoms.

What I do is different. I sit with you, understand your business, and then take the problem apart — all the way down to its smallest meaningful pieces. No assumptions carry over. No sacred cows. From that foundation, I rebuild: selecting only what serves your actual objective, configured for maximum impact within your real constraints.

This isn't a methodology I invented in a boardroom. It's how I was trained at MIT — where every engineering problem starts with first principles, no matter how complex. It's how I evaluated companies at BID Equity — measuring not just current performance but structural growth potential. It's how I built strategies at Roland Berger — grounded in deep technical analysis, not PowerPoint. And it's how I transformed technology operations at BMW — scouting innovations, benchmarking against the best, and redesigning how an entire development department worked.

I work with established businesses — often €50M+ in revenue — where the leadership knows something needs to change but can't see the path clearly. And I work on high-stakes technology decisions where the cost of getting it wrong is measured in millions and years.

If you've been told your problem is too complex, that you need to accept incremental improvement, or that the window has passed — I'd like to hear about it. I tend to see things differently.
